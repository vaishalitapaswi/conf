-  everything is service....hosting services, ( hardware, operation system, applicatons...)

* stack Open, azure stack, vcloud


Four most imporant characterstic of clould:
service
elastic
unlimited
HA

everthing is service
ondemand scalable - elastic
unlimited computation - 
storage 
High availibility
----------\

Scalability - 
sacle up - vertical
scale out - horizantal - via load balancer
* the generic scalibily is 
------------------

Elasticity - other name -> autoScale
- always in scale out 



Capex -

classification in clould
1) based on deployment
2) bases services provide/ model



	2) bases services provide
		1) IAAS
		2) PAAS
		3) SAAS

Framework for provide PAAS:
CF - clound foundary - uses cloud based services to provide paas

Open shift
Service fabric - by microsoft - azure

PAAS for microservices
	
* Monolothic -> SOA - > Microservice 
* in PAAS - In memory VM ... called container based
* Opt for go for readily avaiable paas or you can customized it i.e devops like create CF, service fabric etc
*
	best example -  Elastic beanstack
			Elastic beanstack with docker runtime ..... 		
			EC containers.....custom container by aws like docker

- microservice with service fabric
- we can see power of clould in PAAS ....

To develop a microservice - 12 factor apps should be required

* IBM blumix pure PAAS
* Cloud Foundary is pure PAAS
* 
* PAAS most popular service model

SAAS
	examople 	-google aps
			-o365
			-one drive
			
			
	2)based on deployment
		
		public -
		private - 
		Hybrid -  is most popular deployment model

Amzaon colud characteristics:

 -Availabily and Reliablity
 -Scalabilty and Elasticity
 -Performance
 -Flexible ( Numberous options of programming, 
 -Secure

******************
EC2-
Every VM is called ec2 instance or once instance of ec2 is a ec2

collection of rules is called security group  on ec2 ( RDP, R1, R2m SSH........set of firewalls )

firewall rules -- on public ips

EC2 creates server instance
multiple server inside instance are connected via private IP


AMI - amazon machine image 

spot instance - from bid ( for 1 or 2 or some month)

EC2 is elastic
- 

Features highlights
- Elastic
Flexible
secure
Cheapeer
Ready to uyse AMI
Reliable

EC2 - by default root file syste is EBS

EBS (SAN)  
C:, D:

EFS (IP ; f1)
\\IP\f1



- collection of firewall group is called security group
- windows - rdp - Administrator - dynamically generate passs
linux - ssh (putty) - ec-user - dynamically generate passs


cytrography:
--symetric - secrect/shared key - DES/3DES/AES 
--asymetric - public key - RSA - (to use in network), use as key/pair - public and private key
- hybrid (symetric + asymetric- session key enc - DES with RSA
- hash - one way - (MD4, MD5, SHA)

Two operations
- encrypt - -> key and algo
- dec -- >

EC2 use Assymetric (ASyn)

- Dedicated puublic EIP - elastic IP, it used remap with new ec2 instance

VPC - Virtual Private Cloud

- public and privae subnets, your own IP address range within in sbunet , simple to use, hybrid clould, no colst, added security measures

why VPC: improved secuietym control of netweork and IPm secuierty group and acl, fixed IP, 




subnet - collection of ip address

ipv4:
ip address : 32 bit adress ( binary bits)

divided in 4 groups ( each grop 8 bit - called octct )
- subnet - netwrok in main network (convert a house into apartment)

VPC

any port below 1024 is inside system, 
port 80 only receive, stateless

http:/ it's firewall friendly protocol, it's only one protocol ..... 
sql - server have 1433, 

physical -> newtwork()-> transport(tcp/udp)  -> application (snmop, htttp, ftp, smtp)



port is service end point, identification of service
combition of IP and Port is socket

IP represent system and Port represet service
